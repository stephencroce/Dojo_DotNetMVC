    //Q2:  what is 'use strict' and what is the benefit of using it?

    //A:  http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strict.asp

    //    "use strict";  Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".

    //The "use strict" Directive
    //    The "use strict" directive is new in JavaScript 1.8.5 (ECMAScript version 5).

    //It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.

    //The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".

    //With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.

    //Note	Strict mode is supported in:
    //    Internet Explorer from version 10. Firefox from version 4.
    //    Chrome from version 13. Safari from version 5.1. Opera from version 12.
    //    Declaring Strict Mode
    //    Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a JavaScript file, or a JavaScript function.

    //    Declared at the beginning of a JavaScript file, it has global scope (all code will execute in strict mode):

    "use strict";   //y will error out.  if you comment out this line, it will not error out.   this is similar to option explicit in VB

    function giveMeX() {
        var x = 3.14;
        console.log("x is ", x);


        y = 9.99;
        console.log("y is ", y);

    //Q3:
    //self-executing anonymous function.   preventing the problem of "littering the global namespace with functions and variables, all tenuously linked to each other
    //through a combination of rudimentary comments, and potentially unspoken developer knowledge.
    //http://markdalgleish.com/2011/03/self-executing-anonymous-functions/

    //note the difference between these two functions:
    function nonSelfExecuting() {
        console.log('non self-executing.  I need to be attached to an event, like onclick(), and only then will my output show up in the log.');
    }

    //the parens around this, along with the fact that it has no name denote it as an ANONYMOUS function.  This will not execute.
    var stupid = (function () {
        console.log('I am an anonymous function because unlike the function above me, I have no name.  I an NOT not self-executing, so my output will not show up in the log when i run the page');

    //are placed inside of the self executing function, everything evaluated to 3.

        <p>A:  obviously testing what you know about equivalence operators in Javascript, and also what you know about the typeOf() function - what is the significance of "==="?</p>
        <p>Nutshell:<br />  ==	equal to <br />
===	equal value and equal type</p>
        <p>and so the answer likely has something to do with nulls</p>
